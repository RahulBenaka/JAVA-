Which line(s) of the following code would give an error:
public static void main (String[] args) {
    int a=10,b=20;
    System.out.println(a+++--b);//line 1
    System.out.println(a--+++b);//line 2
    System.out.println(a++-++b);//line 3
    System.out.println(a+++++b);//line 4
}
Options
line 1
line 2 
line 3
line 4 
Correct Answer: line 2 and line 4
Solution Description
As + operator and ++ operator have equal precedence. Similarly - and -- have equal precedence. So in line 2 +++b and in line 4 +++b gives an error. To solve this error we can use +(++b).
