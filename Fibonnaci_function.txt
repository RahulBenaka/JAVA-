My Solution: 

	public static boolean checkMember(int n){
		        int n1 = 0, n2 =1;
        
        int n3 = 0;
        
        boolean bool = false;
        
        if(n==0 || n==1){
            bool = true;
            return bool;
        }
        
            while(n3<=n){
            	n3 = n1+n2;
            	n2=n3;
             n1 =n2;
                if(n == n3){
                    bool = true;
                    break;
                }
        	}	
        
            return bool;
}

Problem with my solution: Didnt satisfy 3 of the test cases while submitted. Should debug.
