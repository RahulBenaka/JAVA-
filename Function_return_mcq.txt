Would the following code generate an error:
public static double add(int a,int b)
{
    float c=a+b;
    return c;
}
public static void main (String[] args) {
    System.out.print(add(10,3));
}

Answer: No (Reason: Implicit type conevrsion are allowed while returning values)

(if it was int in function and u are returning float or double, it would have thrown an error)
