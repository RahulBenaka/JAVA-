Send Feedback
Given an integer array A of size n. Find and print all the leaders present in the input array. An array element A[i] is called Leader, if all the elements following it (i.e. present at its right) are less than or equal to A[i].
Print all the leader elements separated by space and in the same order they are present in the input array.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Integer n, size of array
Line 2 : Array A elements (separated by space)

 leaders of array (separated by space)
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^6
