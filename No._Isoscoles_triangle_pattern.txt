Here 2nd loop runs till n+i-1 coz, till n no. of times we print spaces upto j<n-i and for j>n-i and upto j<=n we print the numbers.
Then we have to again print the no.s in reverse order. if we observe carefully, in every ith row, there will be (i to n) no.s increasing and
(i - 1 to 1) no.s decreasing till 1. so in total we have to run the 2nd loop for n - i + 1 times.
